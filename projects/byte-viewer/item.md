I created this project when I was exploring how the PICO-8 steganography works. This tool opens binary files and displays them as a grid of bytes. Bytes can be viewed in the grid as either decimal or hexadecimal. Hovering over a byte will display the byte value in binary. The grid also shows ASCII characters where possible. The grid shows 16\*16 bank of bytes (0x00-0xFF), but this bank can be cycled or changed. The app also has a decimal-binary/binary-decimal converter.
