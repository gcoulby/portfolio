This album was another quick mix. I had just bought a Maschine Micro Midi controller and really wanted to put it through its paces. Exploring how to sample with it and how to produce, mix and master tracks. I was still inspired by the LoFi sessions volume 1, so I thought LoFi sessions volume 2 would be good to make and I created this album in 6 days.
