I was playing lego with my daughter, who loves electronics so I decided to build a laser turret as I knew I had a couple of servos in my components cabinet. The laser was added simply because lasers are awesome, even if they do intimidate me somewhat (hence the wide angle beam!). This was relatively simple control logic, so I just threw it together in Arduino IDE, as PlatformIO seemed a little overkill for what was required.

I started with just some simple code to automate the movement of the turret. I then added a control layer with 2 potentiometers so that I could control the lateral and longitudinal movement of the laser.
