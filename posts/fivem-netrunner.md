This is project is a sci-fi hacking mod for GTA V FiveM built upon the QBCore Framework. Allows a player to play as a netrunner and 'Jack In' to the net. While in the net they can access cameras around the city, which can be used to hack into door locks to gain access to buildings.

This mod uses TimeCycle modifiers and animations to give the netrunning effect and uses MenuV to provide interactions as a netrunner.

A configurable change-based mini game is attached to each camera, to make it more difficult to get into the cameras. The difficulty of the game can be set in Config.lua and is set per location.

Stress levels increase while in the net, when stress levels reach 100 there will be fatal consequences!
