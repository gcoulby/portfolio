I love the Asset panel of Affinity, but it can be very frustrating to open each SVG individually and copy them all into the asset panel. This application is for creating a single file that can be imported into Affinity Designer for easy import into the applications Asset panel.

This app also allows SVGs to be recoloured, which is handy as Affinity shows the icons in the panel with their original colour. These may look fine in Light mode, but are then hard to see in dark mode. This allows you to bulk edit the colours of SVGs.
