This is a simple JavaScript application that I created for viewing the percentage of your library that is dedicated to which journals. The app allows you to drag and drop a BibTex _(.bib)_ file into the drop area and it will create a series of pie charts to show the percentage of your literature split by either Journal, Author or Year. Also, in case you're wondering, the name is inspired by Suits üòÅ.
