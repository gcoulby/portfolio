| NOTE: This project writeup is currently under development.

The Virtual Smart Office is a simulated environment to showcase Internet of Things principals and technologies.

The simulator is built using microservice architecture running on Docker, through a docker-compose stack. The stack offers a one-stop-shop to deliver a series of microservices that

### Client Application

The purpose of the client application is to provide a dashboard and ‘front-end’ to the Virtual Smart Office. The application provides a graphical SVG model of the office, with interactive elements that can be ‘turned on’ and ‘turned off’.

### MQTT Controls

The client also displays a series of toggle switches. These provide a real-time, multi-pub/sub interface, whereby multiple clients can publish and subscribe to the MQTT messages being transmitted/received from/to the client.

> The virtual Air Conditioners and Air Purifiers used in this simulation do not have an effect on the data generated in the graphs. Their only purpose is to simulate/showcase MQTT control over the building.

### Data Graphs

The application also displays sensor telemetry from simulated IoT environmental quality sensors. These data from these ‘devices’ are generated by the **`IEQ Predictor`** service and are generated using an **Autoregressive Long Term Short Term Memory Neural Network,** which is trained on IEQ data captured from a previous study entitled “Personalised and Sustainable IEQ Monitoring: Use of Multi-Modal and Pervasive Technologies” (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20064897) - This is explained in the IEQ Predictor section below.

### Mobile Application

This uses the the same code as the client application. The docker-compose file uses the same build command as the client application:

```docker
build: ./client/
```

However, the mobile application sets the following flag in the environment variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_MOBILE=true
```

When the React app sees this flag, it shows only the toggle switches and the connect buttons, this saved writing two separate implementations of the application.

### IEQ Predictor

### API

### MQTT (Mosquitto)

### Timeseries Database (InfluxDB)

### Data Visualisations (Grafana)
