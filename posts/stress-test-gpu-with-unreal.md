I was fortunate to put a preorder in for the RTX3070 and did so without any expectation of the chip shortage or the scalping. When I received my card, there was only a few games that really showed off the capabilities of raytracing and DirectX 12, one of which would barely run at launch ***Cyberpunk!***.

In the end I decided to make some experiments in Unreal Engine to test it out. Unity HDRP had some raytracing aspects to it, but Unreal was on the turning point of Unreal 5 and was already making strides ahead of unity in the high fidelity graphic space. 

Here are just a few of the demos I made to test the ray tracing of the card.
