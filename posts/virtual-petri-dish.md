For this project I wanted to create a simulated petri dish under a microscope. I often play with this and experiment with the parameters to get funky results with the cell structures. My plan with this project is to add realtime cell behaviour adjustments. I would love to get this to a stage where the cells fight for food, reproduce and mutate.
