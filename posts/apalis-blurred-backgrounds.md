The Apalis Blurred Backgrounds Collection, was a collection of graphic resources for making websites or other media. These were made back in 2012 under the name of Apalis, which was a name I was using for my design and media work. I dropped this when starting my PhD as I felt it were more appropriate to have everything under my name.

This product is essentially a collection of blurred backgrounds in 8K Resolution (W:7680px H:4320px). They are all categorised under six categories _(Earth, Wind, Fire, Ultraviolet, Day & Night)_ based on the colour palettes used in each background.

I later developed this concept further and developed a blurred background generator, for generating blurred backgrounds in web pages:
