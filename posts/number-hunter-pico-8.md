This is my second game for the PICO-8. It's a simple 'hacking' game where you have to find a static number in a grid of randomly changing numbers. The game is written in Lua and uses the PICO-8 API. It is based on hacking mini games I used to play on FiveM servers.

This image contains the entire game, including the map, sprites, music and sound effects and can be run on the Pico-8:

#### Instructions

The goal of the game is find the fixed target number amongst the constant random generation of numbers on the screen.

You can move the cursor around the screen using ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è and pressing üÖæÔ∏è to select a number.

You will gain points based on the time it takes you to find the target number and the level of difficulty you have selected.

This game stores your high score locally on your PICO-8 console.
