This app is an extension of a previous game I made for my daughter when she was 1-2 years old. The first version just had a button that scrolled through the pictures and she liked to say the words and listen to the sounds.

This version of the game is an extension of that, but requires her to type the letters of each word into the app to advance to the next picture.
