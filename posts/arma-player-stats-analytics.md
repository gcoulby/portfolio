When running an ARMA server we were always bombarded with cheaters, since by the game was around 10 years old, the cheats had become matured. I developed a series of tools to help catch cheaters. I used APIs and front end applications that provided leader boards on key metrics and got the community engaged with this content. This was a first line of defence for catch anomalous behaviour as the community would report if someone shot past them on the leader board. I also had a series of backend tools that would conduct analysis on moving averages of data and store them in InfluxDB to display to game administrators using Grafana. This was for capturing standard deviations away from normal activities, which would trigger automated alerts and inform the team.
