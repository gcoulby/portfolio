I have a guitar, which I got off a good friend some time ago that I call the "Pink Flamingo". It is a cheap, bright pink. Fender Stratocaster copy. It's far from being without issues, but I got it for nothing and it actually plays quite well. I picked up Native Instruments Komplete, which had a nice guitar amplifier modelling suite in it. I creating this album as a means to relax and it only took 4 days for this one. I moved away from the LoFi hiphop for this one and aimed to create a musical meditation. Since I was not sampling breaks, or movies for this one I decided to release it on major music platforms such as Spotify and iTunes.
