After starting my PhD it quickly became apparent that you need to promote yourself almost like a brand. I therefore decided to create a logo, new website, and custom stationery to rebrand myself.

I wanted to create a logo that was modern and minimalistic as my idea for the website was basically a CV style website with an academic look and feel. The logo was designed using [Julieta Ulanovsky's Montserrat font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat):
