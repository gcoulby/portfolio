I made this app based on code from the Ironsworn Companion. This component was used to add icons to custom assets, but I found myself needing the icons elsewhere so found myself inspecting elements and copying the codes out.

I created this app to implement a searchable interface for getting icons from GameIcon.net using Kyle Kemp's web font implementation. This tool provides a quick way to search and copy icons in various formats.
