This is project provides the player with an online casino so that they can gamble on the go. 

I am really pleased with how this mod has come out. Due to its complexity, I built the NUI app in Vue with Vite. By using `npm run watch` during development, I can have the app continually build static files that are imported into the game. This made development much more rapid. Most of the UI was built just in the browser, then I moved it over to FiveM when I was ready to add the backend hooks and game logic. 

This is still a work in progress, but I am really happy with how this is turning out.
