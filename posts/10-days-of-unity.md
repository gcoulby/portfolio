For this project I had completed a udemy course on unity and I wanted to put some of the skills I had learned to practice, rather than just blind following a video tutorial. I challenged myself to 10 days of unity, where everyday I had to make something that had a visual element and a scripting element. There was no goal in mind, except that each day I should have a visible output of my work. 

#### Day 1 - Experimenting with 2D shadows

In day 1 I explored 2D shadows as well as top down movement. To add further challenge the light followed the mouse pointer while the tank moved on WASD.

#### Day 2 - 2D Joints and gravity

In day 2 I explored 2D joints and gravity to make a free swinging light that built on day 1 to cast shadows

#### Day 3 - Volumetric Lights and parallaxing

In day 3 I used the light from day 2 and expanded on it to create a little platformer scene with parallaxed backgrounds and volumetric light effects as well as an animated character.

#### Day 4 - 2D joints and chains

In Day 4 I brought together a few of the skills from previous days to have an animated sprite that could throw grapple hooks out like on Terraria.

#### Day 5 - 3D Jumping game

In day 5 I wanted to recreate one of the mini games from pummel party, which required the player to jump over or duck under obstacles.

#### Day 6 - Physics, Colliders and Spawning

In day 6 I made a spawner to spawn entities in the scene which would fall like those falling sand ornaments

#### Day 7 - Spaceship with towing mechanics

In day 7 I wanted to try and emulate one of my favourite games from my childhood - Solar Jet Man.

I expanded on the idea to create a tractor beam effect:

#### Day 8 - Proximity based background spawning

In day 8 I expanded on my spaceship controller as I felt it was bad-practice to load 50*50 background tiles in the scene, so I created a script that would spawn the next tile in based on your proximity direction of travel.

#### Day 9 - 3D Physics - attractors

In Day 9 I was experimenting with making attractors so that solid bodies would be attracted to one another based on their mass and angular velocity.

#### Day 10 - Celestial body orbiting 

To round off the challenge, I built upon Day 9 and created a planetary orbit system, where lower mass bodies would orbit larger bodies, and then expanded it to draw orbit lines

Multi-body orbitting with orbit lines lines:
