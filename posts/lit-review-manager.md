This is a tool I created to help me manage my literature reviews. It is a simple React app that allows you to import search results from Scopus. It allows you to add comments to the references and also flag references as "included" or "excluded". There is also a feature to copy prompts for Microsoft Edge's Discovery Tool, for getting GPT generated summaries of the references for helping to decide whether to include them in the review.
