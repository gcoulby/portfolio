This project is an extension of a previous project of the same name [Virtual Smart Home](https://grahamcoulby.co.uk/portfolio/virtual-smart-home/). This version was developed for Northumbria's [Connected Home project](https://newsroom.northumbria.ac.uk/pressreleases/designing-homes-that-are-fit-for-the-future-3167005) to develop the virtual smart home concept into a physical model. The research team developed 3D printed models of their conceptual house designs and I developed a new version of the virtual smart home that mirrored the design of that house [https://feeitadmin.github.io/VirtualSmartHome/](https://feeitadmin.github.io/VirtualSmartHome/). To complement the design I also developed an IoT device that was integrated into the 3D printed model that could also be simultaneously controlled alongside the virtual smart home project. This provided a tactile extension to the virtual smart home concept and brought the project to life.
