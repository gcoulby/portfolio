Passive IEQ monitoring with digital technologies may provide insightful quantitative data to better inform, e.g., health interventions. Yet, many traditional approaches with known IEQ technologies have limited utility due to high costs or coarse granularity—focusing on the collective rather than individuals. Equally, subjective approaches (e.g., manual surveys) have poor adherence (i.e., are burdensome). There is a need for holistic IEQ measurement techniques that are sustainable (affordable, i.e., low-cost) and personalised. Here, the aim of this case report is to explore the use of low-cost digital approaches to gather personalised quantitative and qualitative data. Methods: This study deploys a personalised monitoring approach with IEQ devices coupled to wearables, weather data, and qualitative data, captured through a post-study interview. Results: The mixed-method, single-case approach gathered data continuously for six months with a reduced burden, by using digital technologies to affirm environmental factors, which were subjectively evaluated by the participant. Quantitative data reinforced qualitative data, removing the need for generalising qualitative findings against a collective. Conclusions: This study showed that the single-case, mixed-method approach used here can provide a holistic approach not previously obtainable with traditional pen-and-paper techniques alone. The use of a low-cost multi-modal device linked with common home and wearable technology suggest a contemporary and sustainable IEQ measurement approach that could inform future work to better determine occupant health.","keywords":["Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)","Personalised Assessment","Multi-modal Monitoring","Sensors","Internet of Things (IoT)","Building Occupants"],"authorType":"First Author"}}],["$","$La","publication-item-1",{"item":{"title":"A protocol for longitudinal monitoring of individual building occupants and their environments","publicationType":"Journal Article","publicationDate":"$D2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","publisher":"PLOS ONE","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274015","abstract":"Buildings account for approximately 40% of the energy consumption across the European Union, so there is a requirement to strive for better energy performance to reduce the global impact of urbanised societies. However, energy performant buildings can negatively impact building occupants (e.g., comfort, health and/or wellbeing) due to a trade-off between airtightness and air circulation. Thus, there is a need to monitor Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) to inform how it impacts occupants and hence redefine value within building performance metrics. An individualised study design would enable researchers to gain new insights into the effects of environmental changes on individuals for more targeted e.g., health interventions or nuanced and improved building design(s). This paper presents a protocol to conduct longitudinal monitoring of an individual and their immediate environment. Additionally, a novel approach to environmental perception gathering is proposed that will monitor environmental factors at an individual level to investigate subjective survey data pertaining to the participant’s perceptions of IEQ (e.g., perceived air quality, thermal conditions, light, and noise). This protocol has the potential to expose time-differential phenomena between environmental changes and an individual’s behavioural and physiological responses. This could be used to support building performance monitoring by providing an interventional assessment of building performance renovations. In the future it could also provide building scientists with a scalable approach for environmental monitoring that focuses specifically on individual health and wellbeing.","keywords":["Protocol","Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)","Internet of Things (IoT)","n-of-1","Methodology"],"authorType":"First Author"}}],["$","$La","publication-item-2",{"item":{"title":"IoT in the Wild: An expedition of discovery for remote monitoring.","publicationType":"Conference Proceedings","publicationDate":"$D2021-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","publisher":"UbiComp/ISWC 2021","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3460418.3479364","abstract":"Free-living assessment and remote monitoring is important for healthcare researchers.

Consequently, these devices have become an interest to healthcare researchers and medical professionals. However, these devices typically come with their own proprietary software—standalone technology that makes daily use for patient management difficult. Challenges surrounding data access present steep learning curves and barriers to entry for many researchers, with computer science commonly being a prerequisite. This chapter explores frameworks for wearable technologies and does so from two angles. The first angle explores the concept of frameworks from the position of systems and data management, that is, software frameworks. In this regard, the chapter presents the challenges and complexities researchers may face when attempting to extract data from these devices. We present several approaches to that researchers can use to collect data, which cater for different levels of technological capability. In presenting these approaches, the lack of digital frameworks, in the context of standardization and governance, is identified. This presents the second angle of frameworks explored by this chapter. There is a need for a National Digital Framework that is tailor-made for wearable technology, but the complexity and heterogeneity of current digital frameworks is indicative of how challenging this process will be. By exposing these needs and presenting researchers with a range of approaches for wearable technology data extraction, it is hoped that researchers of any specialism can drive the research and development of wearable health technologies and the frameworks that underpin them.","keywords":["Internet of Things (IoT)","Wearable Health Technology","Personal Fitness Tracker (PFT)","framework","National Digital Framework","Daily Patient Management","Accessible Technology"],"authorType":"First Author"}}],["$","$La","publication-item-4",{"item":{"title":"Low-cost, multimodal environmental monitoring based on the Internet of Things","publicationType":"Journal Article","publicationDate":"$D2021-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","publisher":"Building and Environment","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108014","abstract":"Monitoring Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is of growing interest for health and wellbeing.

Restrictions imposed by COVID often result in a cessation of clinical research. Previously, proposals for remote individualised measurement at scale were made but cost and complexity of physiological and environmental sensing made this unfeasible. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are increasing feasibility, making it more achievable and affordable to conduct remote monitoring. This removes dependency on clinics/laboratories and longitudinal free-living assessment can provide an abundance of information on habitual behaviours and pathology characteristics, often not attainable during supervised assessments. Here, we reviewed emergent low-cost/accessible IoT technologies to inform healthcare researchers about opportunities and constraints. Through experimentation, we explored and demonstrate workflows for individualised remote monitoring with wearables alongside environmental conditions of the buildings they occupy. We also explored the costs associated with cloud platforms and explored the ThingSpeak platform - as an extension of MATLAB to identify its suitability within healthcare research. We found that data/computer science are becoming increasingly common in healthcare, which is resulting in more reliance on multi-disciplinary teams to make innovations with disruptive IoT technologies. The latter enable researchers to experiment with low-cost devices that incorporate a range of sensors for monitoring patients and the environments they inhabit. However, the requirement for high-frequency data (often required in healthcare research, e.g. electrocardiogram, gait analysis) are challenging with current technologies. More research is needed to identify workflows that make low-cost IoT technologies feasible to healthcare researchers measuring high-frequency physiological data f rom wearables. Alternatively, environmental data is readily attainable f rom current technologies, which would be useful to provide context and greater insights to free-living physiological/wearable assessments.","keywords":["Healthcare","Remote Monitoring","Gait","Internet of Things (IoT)","Free Living"],"authorType":"First Author"}}],["$","$La","publication-item-6",{"item":{"title":"Towards remote healthcare monitoring using accessible IoT technology: state‑of‑the‑art, insights and experimental design","publicationType":"Journel Article","publicationDate":"$D2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","publisher":"Biomedical Engineering Online","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-020-00825-9","abstract":"Healthcare studies are moving toward individualised measurement.

Few studies localise measurements to an occupant level perhaps due to many environmental monitoring solutions being large and expensive. Traditional models for occupant comfort analysis often exacerbate this by not differentiating between individual building occupants.

These narratives are changing the way the construction sector operates, putting an emphasis on projects that can evidence a measurable impact on these performance indicators. Green Building standards (e.g. WELL and LEED) are addressing these challenges by making occupant health and wellbeing a focus of accreditation within building design. This is ushering in a new understanding of value that counterpoints the concept of value engineering”; which can become more of an exercise of cost-cutting than value improvement. The last decade has seen the rise of the living lab research paradigm, placing individuals at the centre of research and development. Living labs are physical environments that act as a laboratory, gathering data and learning from users. By linking building information and Internet-of-Things (IoT) data with occupant feedback, the construction sector can develop buildings as living labs and take an occupant-centric approach to how they innovate the entire building lifecycle. This paper explores a conceptual approach to how principles, workflows and technologies could be incorporated into a toolbox that would underpin living lab research in buildings. The principles presented, above all else, highlight the need and value of multi-disciplinary research in this domain. Research siloes have resulted in ambiguity in terminology and research methods, which is forcing current research to sit at the precipice of what is possible. By unifying multidisciplinary approaches, i.e. technologies, workflows and disciplines, to create a suite of tools, it is felt that researchers could provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between building and occupant that is currently seen across the literature base. This would add value to researchers and practitioners and aim to address an industry need for transparency, verbosity, and accountability of building information.","keywords":["Internet of Things (IoT)","Living Labs","Blockchain","Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)","BuildingsSensors"],"authorType":"First Author"}}]]]}]}],["$","hr",null,{"className":"m-0"}],["$","$Lb",null,{}],["$","hr",null,{"className":"m-0"}],["$","section",null,{"className":"resume-section","id":"interests","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"resume-section-content","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"mb-5 text-dark","children":"Interests"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"I am a passionate technologist and I love all aspects of development from embedded systems to front-end development and have a particular love for Vue/Nuxt/React/Next and use these on many of my projects.
