          <p>
            I am a passionate technologist and I love all aspects of development from embedded systems to front-end development and have a particular
            love for Vue/Nuxt/React/Next and use these on many of my projects. Aside to my professional skills I am also interested in graphic design,
            music production, 3D modelling, video & tabletop gaming, electronics, retro computing, and games development. I have a keen interest in
            virtual reality, and I am familiar with Unity, Unreal and PICO-8 game engines, though this is very much in a hobbyist capacity. I am
            interested in embedded systems and IoT devices e.g., FPGA / Arduino / Raspberry Pi development. The latter skills, coupled with my
            experience working with architects and BIM, are what inspired me to begin researching smart homes and IoT technologies.
